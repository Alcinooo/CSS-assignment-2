# RUBRIC for the Assignment

15 points maximum

## 5 points:

* Your correct and complete GitHub URL is submitted in Canvas by the deadline.

* Your repo contains the forked contents of the original repo PLUS a new branch named *gh-pages*.

* In the *gh-pages* branch, the file *main.css* has been changed as instructed in Part 1 here: https://github.com/macloo/CSS-assignment-2  

* The file *index.html* in the *gh-pages* branch has NOT been changed in ANY way.

(All criteria must be met to get 5 points.)

## 10 points:

All of the above. Plus:

* The new files *twosides.html* and *twosides.css* are in your repo, in the correct locations, according to the instructions under Part 2 here:  https://github.com/macloo/CSS-assignment-2

* All instructions in Part 2 have been followed to alter those two new files.

* Your CSS validates (both CSS files) [here](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

* Your HTML validates (both HTML files) [here](https://html5.validator.nu/).

(All criteria must be met to get 10 points.)

## 15 points:

All of the above. Plus:

* The floats work (*twosides.html* and *twosides.css*) â€” meaning the right-side content does not fall below the left-side content in any section.

* The section background colors are as they should be.

* Padding and alignment in the *twosides* version looks close to the version shown in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKXZBsOr0JM&list=PLZFU-W6LLeecJuSQh20QUU_gCmS30sLTB&index=31). Notice that text that was *centered* in the other version of the page is NOT centered in the *twosides* version. Notice also that the article text does NOT wrap under the image. 

**Note:** My maximum screen width is 1280 pixels, and the content must not touch the left and right edges of the window. Keep in mind that PERCENTAGES work better than pixels for width when floating. However, the images have a width in pixels, so the left side must be wide enough for them.

* Your HEADER on both pages achieves all criteria listed in Part 1 for the HEADER, and your HEADER looks and behaves like the one shown in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKXZBsOr0JM&list=PLZFU-W6LLeecJuSQh20QUU_gCmS30sLTB&index=31).

* All hexadecimal RGB codes are used correctly. No color words!

* All punctuation marks required in the CSS file are used correctly.

* The CSS and HTML are formatted neatly, with sensible indents and use of linespaces that make code easy to read.

* All text has good contrast against the background color, regardless of which element contains it. This includes links.

* You could show your two final pages to anyone, not just your instructor.

## DISHONESTY

Showing your code to any other student, or giving another student code to solve the problem, or any part of the problem, is a violation of the university's honor code. Asking for a solution in any online forum is a violation of the university's honor code. Copying code from another student, past or present, is a violation of the university's honor code. Allowing anyone else to write code for you is a violation of the university's honor code. You must do your own work, or risk a failing grade for the entire course. Penalties for academic dishonesty are spelled out in the syllabus for this course.
